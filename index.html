      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring system administrator/DevOps engineer with
         an interest in linux systems and cloud infrastructure. I have
         experience with a wide variety of linux systems and I have
         both deployed and built applications on them. Some of my interests 
         include system administration, developer operations, and network
         administration. I also have both knowledge and experience when it
         comes to designing and implementing computer networks with 
         multiple VLANS and subnets and can quickly and efficently plan out
         and document an entire network.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Swoop Marketplace</h3>
      <p>Swoop Marketplace was a 3 tier cloud native web
         application that I helped create along with 3 other people. This was 
         a semester long project which was done as part of the course work for 
         ITMT-430. We used Github as our version control and deployed our
         application to a proxmox server hosted on IIT's Rice Campus.
         We used the laravel framework to develop a mock marketplace
         that users could sign in to and view items that were for
         sale. Users who were administrators could also upload images
         to create their own listings.
      </p>
      <p>Our site featured support for Google Authentication. Users were 
         able to login with their Hawk accounts through google. After users 
         logged in they could browse the catalog of products that were available 
         on the site and add them to the shopping cart to simulate browsing and 
         checking out on a real store page. Our catalog page also featured a 
         search bar which users could type the name of a product. 
         This would create a SQL Query which looked for products in our 
         database and update the site with any result that matched.
