    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Swoop Marketplace</h3>
    <p>Swoop Marketplace was a 3 tier cloud native web application
       that I helped create along with 3 other people. We used the 
       laravel framework to develop a mock marketplace that users could
       sign in to and view items that were for sale. Users who were 
       administrators could also upload images to create their own listings.
